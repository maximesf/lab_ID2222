Soccer, or football as it is known in most parts of the world, is more than just a sport—it is a cultural phenomenon that transcends borders, languages, and generations. It is the world’s most popular game, played and loved by billions of people on every continent. From the bustling streets of Rio de Janeiro to the quiet villages of Africa, from the professional stadiums of Europe to the schoolyards of Asia, soccer serves as a universal language that unites people through shared passion, competition, and joy.

At its core, soccer is a simple game. Two teams of eleven players compete to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team’s net, using any part of the body except the hands and arms. The simplicity of its rules and the minimal equipment required—a ball and some space—make it accessible to nearly anyone. Yet behind this simplicity lies incredible depth. Strategy, teamwork, and individual creativity come together in a constantly shifting balance that makes every match unique.

The history of soccer stretches back thousands of years. Early versions of the game existed in ancient civilizations such as China, Greece, and Rome, where people kicked balls made of animal bladders or leather. However, modern soccer as we know it began in England in the 19th century. Schools and clubs formalized the rules, leading to the establishment of The Football Association in 1863, which standardized gameplay and created a structure for organized competition. From there, the sport rapidly spread across Europe, South America, and eventually the entire world.

One of soccer’s greatest strengths is its universality. It can be played almost anywhere—on grass fields, sandy beaches, concrete streets, or even indoors. Children often start playing with makeshift balls made of plastic bags or old socks, proving that passion for the game does not depend on resources or privilege. This accessibility has helped soccer become a tool for social inclusion and hope in many communities. In developing nations, for instance, soccer programs have been used to keep young people engaged, promote education, and teach teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.

Beyond the local level, soccer’s global competitions bring together nations like no other event. The FIFA World Cup, first held in 1930, has grown into the most-watched sporting event on the planet. Every four years, millions of fans tune in to see their country’s team compete for the ultimate prize. The tournament has given us unforgettable moments: Pelé’s brilliance for Brazil, Maradona’s “Hand of God,” Zidane’s elegance and temper, and Messi’s long-awaited triumph in 2022. For many, these memories are not just about sport—they represent national pride, emotional connection, and the collective heartbeat of millions of people.

The emotional power of soccer lies in its ability to evoke passion, unity, and identity. Fans develop deep loyalties to their clubs and national teams, often passed down through generations. Entire cities come alive on match days, with streets filled with fans wearing team colors, waving flags, and singing chants that echo through the air. Rivalries such as El Clásico between Real Madrid and Barcelona, the Manchester Derby, or Boca Juniors versus River Plate in Argentina are more than just games—they are cultural events that reflect history, class, and local pride.

While soccer unites, it can also divide through these rivalries, corruption scandals, or violent fan behavior known as hooliganism. Yet, even amid controversy, the game’s unifying power remains strong. Organizations like FIFA and UEFA have worked to promote fair play, respect, and inclusion, recognizing soccer’s potential as a global force for good. Initiatives such as “Football for Hope” and grassroots programs around the world use the sport to address social challenges, from racism to gender inequality.

On the field, soccer showcases an extraordinary mix of athleticism and artistry. It is often described as a “beautiful game” because of the creativity it allows. Players express themselves through dribbles, passes, and shots, turning physical competition into a form of performance art. Legends like Pelé, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff, and more recently Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, have elevated the sport through moments of genius that leave fans speechless. Their talent, vision, and determination inspire millions to dream and to play.

Tactics and technology have also evolved dramatically over time. Early soccer was often chaotic, with little structure. But as the sport matured, coaches began to introduce sophisticated formations and playing styles. The Italian “Catenaccio,” Brazil’s attacking flair, Spain’s “tiki-taka,” and modern pressing systems all represent different philosophies of how the game should be played. Today, data analysis, sports science, and video technology play major roles in improving performance and fairness. VAR (Video Assistant Referee), for example, has been introduced to reduce officiating errors, though it remains a topic of debate among fans.

At the grassroots level, soccer continues to be a powerful tool for education and development. In many countries, children learn important life lessons through the game—teamwork, leadership, respect, and resilience. It teaches that success requires cooperation, and that losing is an opportunity to learn and grow. For many young players, soccer offers a path out of poverty, opening doors to education and professional opportunities that might otherwise be unreachable.

Women’s soccer, too, has gained remarkable momentum in recent decades. Once marginalized, it now enjoys global recognition and respect. The FIFA Women’s World Cup showcases incredible talent and has inspired a new generation of girls to pursue their dreams in sports. Players like Mia Hamm, Megan Rapinoe, Marta, and Alexia Putellas have become global icons, proving that soccer is truly for everyone, regardless of gender.

Economically, soccer is a powerhouse. Major clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich generate billions in revenue through broadcasting rights, merchandise, sponsorships, and ticket sales. The business side of the sport has created an entire industry of marketing, sports management, and analytics. However, this commercialization has also sparked debate. Critics argue that excessive money and corporate influence threaten the spirit of the game, making it more about profit than passion. Balancing financial growth with authenticity remains one of soccer’s greatest challenges.

Despite its flaws, soccer’s enduring appeal lies in its simplicity and emotional depth. It is a game where underdogs can triumph, where a single moment of brilliance can change everything, and where the joy of victory or heartbreak of defeat is shared by millions. No matter where one goes in the world, a soccer ball can bring strangers together, break down barriers, and create instant friendships.

In the end, soccer is not just about scoring goals—it is about expression, identity, and connection. It teaches cooperation, perseverance, and respect. It builds communities and bridges cultures. It is both a mirror of society and a force that can shape it for the better. Whether played in a grand stadium under bright lights or on a dusty street at sunset, the essence of soccer remains the same: a shared love for the beautiful game that continues to inspire and unite people across the world.

Labour plans maternity pay rise

Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.

It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as "desperate", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.

Ms Hewitt said: "We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. "We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament." She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. "We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400." She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: "These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters."

She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: "While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected." She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.

Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be "crippled" by the move. "While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be," he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.
Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was
never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;
backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow
lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,
something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which
never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these
silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in
the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he
was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the
theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had
an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with
envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and
in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to
Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the
devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune
to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in
the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came
about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.
Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of
Miss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,
whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is
unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I
cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which
his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its
sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s
scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in
even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he
been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting
under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the
probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in
love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
charm.

Artificial Intelligence: Shaping the Future of Humanity

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. It has reshaped industries, challenged traditional notions of intelligence, and revolutionized how people interact with machines. From voice assistants and recommendation systems to self-driving cars and medical diagnosis tools, AI is embedded in countless aspects of modern life. While its rapid growth offers extraordinary opportunities for innovation and progress, it also raises profound ethical, economic, and social questions that humanity must address responsibly.

The Origins and Definition of AI

AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines—specifically, the ability to learn, reason, and adapt to new information. The concept was first formally introduced in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where pioneers such as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Herbert Simon envisioned creating machines capable of “thinking.” Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, which attempted to represent human knowledge through logic. Although these early programs could solve specific problems, they lacked flexibility and struggled with real-world complexity.

The field evolved significantly with the emergence of machine learning (ML) in the 1980s and 1990s, where instead of explicitly programming a computer to follow fixed rules, scientists designed algorithms that allow machines to learn patterns from data. In the 2010s, a major breakthrough came with deep learning, a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. These networks, made of many layers of computational “neurons,” enabled dramatic improvements in tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.

Applications of AI in Everyday Life

AI has become deeply integrated into everyday experiences. One of the most visible examples is virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, which use natural language processing (NLP) to interpret spoken commands and respond intelligently. AI also powers recommendation algorithms on platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify, personalizing content based on user behavior and preferences.

In healthcare, AI plays a critical role in diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images, and predicting patient outcomes. Algorithms can detect early signs of cancer, identify heart conditions, and even suggest personalized treatment plans. In finance, AI systems detect fraudulent transactions, manage investment portfolios, and assist in algorithmic trading.

Transportation is another field undergoing transformation. Self-driving cars rely on a combination of AI, sensors, and real-time data analysis to navigate safely. Meanwhile, AI optimizes logistics and public transport systems, reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency. Even creative fields are embracing AI, with tools that generate music, visual art, and written content.

Economic and Industrial Impact

AI is reshaping the global economy. Businesses use AI to automate routine tasks, improve decision-making, and gain insights from massive datasets. This leads to greater efficiency and productivity, but also raises concerns about job displacement. Many fear that automation will replace workers in manufacturing, retail, and even white-collar sectors. However, others argue that AI will create new roles requiring creativity, emotional intelligence, and technical expertise.

Governments and organizations are investing heavily in AI research and infrastructure. Countries like the United States, China, and members of the European Union see AI as a strategic priority for national competitiveness. The rise of AI-driven economies is also prompting discussions about data privacy, intellectual property, and digital sovereignty.

Ethical and Social Challenges

While AI promises enormous benefits, it also presents serious ethical challenges. One of the main concerns is bias. AI systems learn from data, and if that data reflects historical inequalities or stereotypes, the resulting models can perpetuate or even amplify discrimination. For example, facial recognition technologies have been found to be less accurate for people of color and women, raising concerns about fairness and accountability.

Privacy is another major issue. Many AI systems rely on collecting and analyzing personal data, from browsing history to facial images. Without proper safeguards, this can lead to surveillance and exploitation. Additionally, the rise of generative AI, capable of producing realistic text, images, and videos, has sparked fears about misinformation and “deepfakes” that can manipulate public opinion.

Transparency and explainability are also essential. Unlike traditional software, AI models—especially deep neural networks—can be opaque, making it difficult to understand how they reach their conclusions. This “black box” problem can be dangerous in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law enforcement, or finance, where wrong decisions can have life-altering consequences. Researchers are now developing “explainable AI” techniques to make algorithms more interpretable and trustworthy.

The Future of Work and Education

AI is fundamentally changing how people work and learn. Automation is replacing repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on more creative and strategic roles. However, this shift requires significant reskilling. Future workers will need to develop new competencies—such as data literacy, problem-solving, and ethical reasoning—to thrive in an AI-driven world.

Education systems are adapting as well. AI tutors and personalized learning platforms are helping students learn at their own pace, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Meanwhile, universities are expanding programs in computer science, machine learning, and data ethics to prepare the next generation of innovators and policymakers.

Toward Artificial General Intelligence

Current AI systems are considered “narrow” or “weak” AI—they excel at specific tasks but lack general understanding or consciousness. Researchers are pursuing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a theoretical form of AI that could perform any intellectual task a human can do. While AGI remains speculative, it raises profound philosophical and ethical questions. Would such an entity have rights or consciousness? How could humanity ensure that AGI acts safely and aligns with human values?

Prominent thinkers such as Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Nick Bostrom have warned of potential existential risks if AI surpasses human intelligence without proper control mechanisms. Others argue that the benefits of superintelligent systems—solving climate change, curing diseases, eliminating poverty—outweigh the risks, provided careful governance and oversight exist.

Global Governance and Regulation

As AI continues to evolve, regulation is becoming increasingly important. The European Union has introduced the AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence, aiming to ensure that AI systems are safe, transparent, and human-centered. Similar efforts are emerging in the United States, Canada, and Asia, focusing on balancing innovation with public protection.

International cooperation will be crucial. Since AI development crosses borders, global standards are needed to address ethical concerns, prevent misuse, and promote fairness. Initiatives by organizations such as the OECD, UNESCO, and the United Nations seek to create shared principles for responsible AI development.

Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept—it is an integral part of modern society. It enhances human capabilities, drives economic growth, and holds the potential to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges. Yet it also forces us to rethink what it means to be human, to make decisions, and to live in a world increasingly shaped by intelligent machines.

The future of AI will depend not just on technological progress, but on ethical wisdom and collective responsibility. By ensuring that AI remains transparent, fair, and beneficial, humanity can harness its power to build a more intelligent, equitable, and sustainable future.

Understanding Artificial Neural Networks: How They Work and Why They Matter

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the most powerful and fascinating technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, neural networks allow computers to recognize patterns, make predictions, and even generate new content. They form the foundation of many modern AI applications—voice recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing, to name just a few. While the underlying mathematics can be complex, the basic ideas behind how different types of neural networks work are surprisingly intuitive.

What Is a Neural Network?

At a high level, a neural network is a system of interconnected “neurons” or nodes arranged in layers. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes information to the next layer. The network learns by adjusting the strength of these connections based on data, improving its performance over time.

Neural networks start with an input layer (which receives raw data), followed by one or more hidden layers (which transform that data), and finally an output layer (which produces the result). During training, the network compares its predictions with the correct answers and adjusts its internal connections to reduce errors—a process known as learning.

While all neural networks share this basic idea, they differ in how they handle data and what problems they are designed to solve. Let’s explore some of the main types.

1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)

The simplest type of neural network is the feedforward neural network. In this structure, information flows only in one direction—from input to output—without looping back.

Feedforward networks are often used for basic tasks like classifying images, recognizing patterns, or predicting outcomes from structured data. For instance, a feedforward network might take features such as a person’s age, income, and education level to predict their likelihood of buying a product.

The network learns by adjusting the strength of connections (called weights) between layers. Over many iterations, it gets better at mapping input patterns to correct outputs. Despite their simplicity, feedforward networks remain the foundation for many modern AI systems.

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

When it comes to analyzing images or visual data, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to choice. CNNs are designed to mimic how the human visual system works. Instead of looking at the entire image at once, CNNs focus on small regions at a time, detecting features like edges, textures, and shapes.

CNNs use special layers called convolutional layers, which apply filters that slide across an image and highlight important features. Early layers might detect simple patterns such as lines or corners, while deeper layers identify more complex features such as faces, objects, or letters.

This hierarchical approach allows CNNs to recognize objects in photographs, read handwritten text, and even detect diseases in medical images. For example, in self-driving cars, CNNs help cameras understand the road by identifying traffic signs, pedestrians, and lane markings.

3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

While CNNs are great for spatial data (like images), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data—that is, data where order matters. Examples include speech, text, time series, and music.

Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have “memory.” They keep track of previous inputs using loops in their architecture. This allows them to understand context—for example, recognizing that the meaning of a word in a sentence depends on the words that came before it.

However, traditional RNNs can struggle with long sequences, as they tend to “forget” earlier information. To address this, researchers developed improved versions such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). These networks include mechanisms to selectively remember or forget information, making them effective for tasks like language translation, speech recognition, and predicting stock prices.

4. Transformer Networks

Transformers represent one of the biggest breakthroughs in AI. Introduced in 2017, they have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). Unlike RNNs, transformers do not process data sequentially—they analyze all parts of a sequence simultaneously.

Transformers use a mechanism called attention, which allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making predictions. For instance, in a sentence, a transformer can learn which words relate to each other, even if they are far apart.

This approach makes transformers faster to train and far more powerful for understanding language. They are the foundation for advanced AI systems like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These models can generate human-like text, answer questions, summarize documents, and even write code—all thanks to the transformer architecture.

5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a fascinating type of neural network designed for creativity. GANs consist of two networks that compete against each other:

The generator, which tries to create fake data that looks real.

The discriminator, which tries to tell the difference between real and fake data.

As they train together, both networks improve—the generator gets better at producing realistic content, while the discriminator becomes better at spotting fakes.

GANs have been used to create stunningly realistic images, generate artwork, design fashion, and even simulate human faces. They also play a major role in the creation of “deepfakes,” which are synthetic videos that can make it appear as if someone said or did something they never did. While powerful, this technology also raises ethical questions about authenticity and misinformation.

6. Autoencoders

Another important category is autoencoders, which are designed to learn efficient representations of data. An autoencoder compresses information into a smaller, simpler form (called encoding) and then reconstructs it back to its original form (decoding).

This process helps the network learn the essential features of the data, which can be useful for tasks such as noise reduction, image compression, and detecting anomalies. For example, autoencoders can identify unusual transactions in financial data or spot defects in manufacturing by learning what “normal” looks like.

7. Reinforcement Learning Networks

Reinforcement learning is a bit different—it’s not about recognizing patterns from labeled data but about learning through trial and error. An AI agent interacts with an environment, receives feedback (rewards or penalties), and learns which actions lead to the best outcomes.

Neural networks are often used as the “brains” of these agents, helping them decide what to do in complex situations. This approach has led to remarkable achievements, such as DeepMind’s AlphaGo, which defeated world champions in the game of Go, and AI systems that can play video games or control robots.

The Future of Neural Networks

As computing power and data availability grow, neural networks continue to evolve. Researchers are working on hybrid architectures that combine the strengths of different models—such as merging CNNs and RNNs for video understanding or integrating transformers into visual recognition systems.

There is also growing interest in making neural networks more efficient and sustainable. Large AI models require enormous computing resources, so scientists are developing techniques for smaller, faster, and greener networks.

Beyond technology, there are important social and ethical discussions about how neural networks should be used. As they become capable of generating text, images, and decisions that influence real lives, it’s vital to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.

Conclusion

Artificial neural networks have come a long way—from simple feedforward models to highly sophisticated systems like transformers and GANs. Each type serves a unique purpose, whether it’s recognizing patterns, understanding language, or generating creative content. Together, they form the backbone of today’s AI revolution.

What makes neural networks remarkable is not just their ability to perform complex tasks but their capacity to learn and adapt. They mirror, in a small way, how humans learn from experience. As research continues, neural networks will become even more capable—helping solve problems, enhance creativity, and reshape how humans and machines coexist in the modern world.

Brown calls for £5.5bn Aids fund

Gordon Brown has called on rich nations to fund a £5.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the Aids epidemic and find a vaccine.

On the fourth day of his six-day tour of Africa, the UK chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. Doubling the £400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives, Mr Brown said on Thursday. He hopes to use the UK's G8 presidency to push the issue forward.

"I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the world's deadliest disease of today - and today the world's least curable disease - HIV/Aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation'," Mr Brown said in a speech during his African tour. The problems of HIV/Aids were inseparable from poverty, he added. "At least $10 billion per annum (£5.5bn) is needed to address the HIV/Aids crisis in low and middle income countries. "Existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic. "The UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (£27bn). A doubling of world aid to halve world poverty." Mr Brown also said he had agreed with the Italian finance minister Domenico Siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.

Currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting, Mr Brown said. He called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each, thereby boosting the market for inoculations. This would be a "large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms", Mr Brown added.

More must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with HIV/Aids and their families, he said. But Aid charity Actionaid criticised Mr Brown's preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on G8 nations to fund HIV/Aids treatments. The charity's head of HIV/Aids in Britain, Simon Wright said: "While encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an HIV vaccine is important, a failure to provide any funding for HIV treatments condemns a generation of people to death. "HIV is decimating African countries, killing the most productive adults who should be working, caring for children and building the economy. An HIV vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. Treatments are needed now." On Wednesday, Mr Brown visited slums in the Kenyan capital Nairobi . He will visit an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women's credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town. The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two.

'Errors' doomed first Dome sale

The initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.

The report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.

The NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. "Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula," he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: "This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled." He added: "Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt." NAO head Sir John Bourn said: "In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal."

Watchdog probes e-mail deletions

The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.

Richard Thomas "totally condemned" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.

Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was "too unlikely to have been a coincidence", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the "e-mail regime" could "support the freedom of information regime".

Mr Thomas said: "The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence." He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.

"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. "But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned." The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.
