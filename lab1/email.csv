I actually haven't found a lab group yet. So I'd love to team up with you! I entered group 32, so you can just join it as well. I also haven't done lab 1a yet, have you done it? Because if not, we could first do lab 1b to try to get the bonus point and then finish lab 1a after. If you want to finish lab 1b before the bonus deadline, then we should start working on it sometime soon. Would you prefer to meet up over zoom or on campus? Also, when works best for you?
Cool! I’ll join your group right after sending this email. I’ve already started lab 1a and managed to cover one question and a sub-question, but I’m totally fine with focusing on lab 1b first so we can go for the bonus point. As for meeting, both Zoom and on campus work for me. I actually live on campus, so meeting at the library would be no problem if that’s more convenient for you.
Have you already found a lab group? If not, I’d be happy to team up with you.
Great! Are you available tomorrow? We could meet at the library around 13:00 tomorrow if that works for you? Or would you prefer some other time? And if tomorrow doesn't work for you, would monday work better?
I'm sorry for the late response my emails didn't refresh correctly, the library is closed on Sunday anyway. I'm free today let me know what time you want to meet up
No worries! I'm also free today, so I can meet up whenever! As a suggestion would 14:00 or 15:00 today work? I could also do later, if that fits your schedule better!
