    "**Problem.** Estimate the number of triangles in a large graph seen as an **edge stream** (only insertions). Exact counting is expensive; TRIÈST is a streaming algorithm that keeps a fixed-size sample of edges and updates triangle counts using those edges.\n",

    "**Key variables:**\n",
    "- `M` — maximum sample size (number of edges kept).\n",
    "- `samples` — list of sampled edges (each edge is a 2-list or tuple `[u, v]`).\n",
    "- `t` — global count of processed elements (edges) from the stream.\n",
    "- `tau` — global estimated count of triangles (incremented/decremented on sample changes).\n",
    "- `tau_local` — dictionary mapping a vertex to its local triangle count contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key functions:**\n",
    "- `sampleEdge` — decides whether a new edge enters the sample (when `t > M` it does with probability `M / t`).\n",
    "- `updateCounters` — when an edge is added or removed from the sample, counters are updated for triangles that become present or absent in the sample.\n",

    "**High level idea.** When a new edge arrives:\n",

The pseudocode uses compact mathematical notation (especially for the update of counters and the sampling probability), which made it difficult to translate directly into code.\n",

    "- how to compute **local triangle counts** efficiently,\n",
