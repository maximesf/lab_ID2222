    "**Problem.** Estimate the number of triangles in a large graph seen as an **edge stream** (only insertions). Exact counting is expensive; TRIÈST is a streaming algorithm that keeps a fixed-size sample of edges and updates triangle counts using those edges.\n",

    "**Key variables:**\n",
    "- `M` — maximum sample size (number of edges kept).\n",
    "- `samples` — list of sampled edges (each edge is a 2-list or tuple `[u, v]`).\n",
    "- `t` — global count of processed elements (edges) from the stream.\n",

    "- `tau_local` — dictionary mapping a vertex to its local triangle count contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key functions:**\n",
    "- `sampleEdge` — decides whether a new edge enters the sample (when `t > M` it does with probability `M / t`).\n",
    "- `updateCounters` — when an edge is added or removed from the sample, counters are updated for triangles that become present or absent in the sample.\n",

    "**High level idea.** When a new edge arrives:\n",

    "- how to determine whether an edge currently belongs to the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these components were tested and validated on small example streams, we extended the implementation to **TRIÈST-Fully-Dynamic**, which required additional logic for deletions, symmetric counter updates, and ensuring consistency when an edge leaves the reservoir.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Can the Algorithm Be Easily Parallelized?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TRIÈST is not easily parallelizable**, mainly for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Shared Reservoir**  \n",
    "   The algorithm relies on a *single* fixed-size reservoir.  \n",
    "   Parallel updates would require multiple threads or machines to modify this shared reservoir, leading to race conditions, overwritten entries, and broken sampling invariants.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strict Ordering of Stream Updates**  \n",
    "   TRIÈST’s probabilistic decisions depend on the **time step `t`**.  \n",
    "   Splitting the stream across workers would destroy the global ordering, making the sampling probabilities invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counter Dependencies**  \n",
    "   Triangle counters must be updated immediately and consistently for every edge operation.  \n",
    "   Parallel updates would require heavy synchronization or locking, removing most of the benefits of parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core algorithm is inherently sequential** because of its reliance on a shared reservoir and strict stream order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the Algorithm Work for Unbounded Graph Streams?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. TRIÈST is explicitly designed to support **unbounded graph streams**, meaning that the stream may grow indefinitely. This is possible thanks to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reservoir sampling**, which stores a *fixed-size* subset of edges regardless of the total stream length.\n",
    "- **Bounded memory usage**, which does not depend on the number of processed edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the Algorithm Support Edge Deletions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TRIÈST-Base does not support deletions.**  \n",
    "It assumes an insert-only stream because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the sampling scheme does not specify how to remove edges from the sample,\n",
    "- triangle counters only increase and never decrease,\n",
    "- the reservoir would no longer represent the current state of the graph if deletions occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle deletions, the algorithm must be replaced by **TRIÈST-Fully-Dynamic**, which adds:\n",
    "\n",
    "- symmetric rules for insertions and deletions,\n",
    "- deletion-aware updates to triangle counters,\n",
    "- logic to remove edges from the reservoir when necessary,\n",
    "- probability functions that maintain unbiasedness even with deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This extended version is required for supporting fully dynamic graph streams.\n",
